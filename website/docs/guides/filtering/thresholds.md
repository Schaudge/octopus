Octopus currently provides simple threshold based filtering. A number of measures that can be used to define a Boolean filter expression. Currently, Octopus only supports expressions with OR operations and the less than (<) and greater than (>) comparators. Furthermore, measure name must appear on the left hand side of each condition in the expression.
